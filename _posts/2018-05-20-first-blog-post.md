Welcome to my blog! My name is Alex Marshall and I am a Software Engineer living
in the Washington D.C. area. I graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, better known as Virginia Tech, with a Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Science.

This is my first blog, so if you happen to stumble across it while it's still
in its early stages, please bear with me while I try to figure out how all of this
works. I'm hoping to maybe post something new here every month or so, so stay tuned!

As you can probably tell, I'm by no means a frontend developer. I used a static
site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] with a theme called [Minimal Mistakes][mm-gh]
to create this website. I figured that through this approach, I could focus less
on the design of my website and more on the content.

Now that I'm on the subject of content, I have a few ideas of what I'd like to
write about on this blog, which I've dubbed 'Bit Blog' (yes, creative, I know):
* Weekend language deep dive, where I spend a weekend learning a programming language
  and discuss my experiences
* Research certain useful (maybe also obscure?) Python modules and discuss their
  features
* Research sub-fields of Computer Science (like Machine Learning, Operating Systems,
   Algorithms, etc.) and discuss what I learned

Basically, what I want this blog to be is a learning experience, both for whoever
is reading the blog as well as for myself. Even if no one ever stumbles across
my website, I think doing this blog will be a value experience for me. There's
a quote that's often misattributed to Albert Einstein (although no less true) which
I think is fitting:

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

Thanks for reading. See you in the next one!
